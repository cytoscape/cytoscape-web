## Coding Patterns

- [2026-03-04] enableMapSet: Any new standalone test entry point MUST call `enableMapSet()` before Immer can handle Map/Set — omitting it causes cryptic test failures.
- [2026-03-04] App API: Core functions in `src/app-api/core/` must have zero React imports. Use `useXxxStore.getState()` instead of hooks.
- [2026-03-04] App API: All public API functions must return `ApiResult<T>` — never throw across the API boundary.
- [2026-03-04] Serialization: Before saving to IndexedDB, proxy objects must be converted with `toPlainObject()`. Map-based data needs specialized serializers.

## Build & CI

- [2026-03-04] Import sorting: Import sorting is no longer lint-enforced after the oxlint migration; keep imports sorted by convention.
- [2026-03-04] No `console.log`: Production builds strip direct `console.*()` calls through Vite's Oxc minifier. Use the `debug` logger from `src/debug.ts`.

## Agent Workflow

- [2026-07-20] Commit cadence: Commit each completed, verified round of work immediately with a detailed message — don't batch rounds or wait to be asked (standing instruction from Max).

- [2026-03-04] Memory consolidation: AGENTS.md is the single source of truth for project context; CLAUDE.md includes it with `@AGENTS.md`. `.serena/memories/` should only contain lessons (this file) and task checklists — not duplicated agent context.
- [2026-07-15] Git sandbox: Branch merges may require elevated permission because the workspace sandbox can read `.git` but cannot create `.git/ORIG_HEAD.lock`.
- [2026-07-15] Commit convention: When Codex makes a commit, prefix the commit message with `Codex: `.
- [2026-07-15] Vitest targeting: Passing a source file such as `src/features/SyncTabs.tsx` to `vitest run` exits 1 when no matching test file exists; locate a test first or run the full unit suite.
- [2026-07-15] Shell quoting: Put ripgrep patterns containing Markdown backticks in single quotes (or split them into fixed-string searches); unescaped backticks inside a double-quoted shell command trigger command substitution or an unmatched-quote failure.
- [2026-07-15] Tool wrapper quoting: JavaScript passed to the orchestration wrapper must safely encode shell commands that contain quote characters; prefer a template literal or JSON-safe string construction so the wrapper parses before execution.
- [2026-07-15] Build-mode types: Source code using `import.meta.env` requires the `vite/client` type reference; when replacing a configuration field, search and migrate every static and context consumer before running the full typecheck.
